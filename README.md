# CPI-Urban
A data visualization of the Consumer Price Index's fluctuation for all urban consumers in the United States from 1913 to 2022 (110 years of data). The code uses the Matplotlib and Pandas libraries to bring this data into an appropriate visualization.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to display the disproportionate rate in which the CPI-U increases as time goes on, with it starting to spike higher at the start of the mid-1970s. 

The CPI-U, or Consumer Price Index of Urban consumers, measures the monthly change in prices paid by U.S. consumers in urban regions. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the CPI as a weighted average of prices for a basket of goods and services representative of aggregate U.S. consumer spending. 

The CPI is one of the most popular measures of inflation and deflation, and is used to report different survey methodology, price samples, and index weights than the producer price index (PPI), which measures changes in the prices received by U.S. producers of goods and services.
